# WindTrace 

## About
WindTrace is a python open-source parametric life-cycle inventory model to create tailor-made inventories of onshore wind turbines and park fleets and assess their environmental impacts.
It has been funded by the European Commission though the Horizon Europe project "JUSTWIND4ALL" (GA 101083936). 


## Getting started
To get ready to use WindTrace, you must first create a virtual environment using the YAML file provided.
WindTrace creates a [Brightway2.5](https://github.com/brightway-lca/brightway25) project and a database within this project where all the inventories you create will be stored. Before you start, you must change the variables `PROJECT_NAME`, and `NEW_DB_NAME` in `consts.py` and choose the names that you wish. 
**IMPORTANT**: at the moment WindTrace is compatible with **Ecoinvent v3.9.1, v3.10 and v3.10.1**. You must have an Ecoinvent license to run WindTrace. \
In consts.py, you must change the **SPOLD_FILES** variable and choose the route where you have the spold files of this Ecoinvent version stored in your computer.

In case you don't want to create wind turbine inventories yourself, you can import into Brightway the database in the folder [turbine_examples](https://github.com/LIVENlab/WindTrace_public/tree/main/turbine_examples), where **2.0 MW, 4.5 MW, 6.0 MW and 8.0 MW turbines with different characteristics are sampled**. As explained later, the individual turbines inventories are stored per unit of turbine under the code `'Park_name'` + `'_single_turbine'`. The same inventories per kWh have the code `'Park_name'` + `'_turbine_kwh'`. To know how the parameters where defined to create these inventories (the technical parameters of the turbine) you can check the comment in the `'Park_name'` + `'_single_turbine'` inventory.


## Parameters
The function allowing to create customized inventories is **lci_wind_turbine()**, which admits the following parameters:
